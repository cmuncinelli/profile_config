<h1 align="center">Hello there 👋, I'm Cicero!</h1>

<p align="center">
  👨‍🔬 Particle physicist | 💻 Developer | 🧪 PhD Student
</p>

---

🎓 I'm a PhD researcher in high-energy physics, working in the field of **heavy-ion collisions**, where I explore the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the early Universe.

🔬 I work with tools like **PYTHIA 8**, **ROOT**, **PyROOT**, **ALICE's O2** and **hydrodynamic simulations**!

My research includes simulations, phenomenology, and *I am a member of the ALICE collaboration at the LHC*.

🚀 Some of my current projects include:
- 📦 Tutorials for PYTHIA and ROOT for undergraduates
- 🧠 Custom Monte Carlo workflows
- ⚙️ Analysis pipelines for particle collision data
- 🌀 Vorticity in the Quark-Gluon Plasma

🛠️ Languages & Tools:
```bash
C++ | Python | Bash | Git | LaTeX | ROOT | PYTHIA
```
